# This is the read me of localrepotest which was mapped to localrepotest-remote .
# I intentially kept the name of local repo and remote repo different. 
# When we create a local repo then their is no branch in remote repo.
# what we will push will be the name of remote repo. if we puch main remote will be main, if we push master remote branch name will also be master
# origin is default name. I kept default-origin by myself instead of origin.
